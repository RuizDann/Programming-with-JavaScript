// JavaScript doesn't have built-in objects or methods that would allow for tests to be written
// Many different libraries have been built to tackle the issue of testing

// Other testing frameworks:
    - Jasmine
    - Mocha
    - Karma
    - qUnit

// What is Jest:
    - A JS testing framework
    - often used for React(JS library by Meta)
    - Able to test others:
        - Babel
        - TypeScript
        - Node
        - Angular
        - Vue
        - various others...
    - supports code coverage (a measure of what percentage of code is covered by tests)
        - higher coverage the lower chance of unidentified bugs

// What is Mocking:
    - allows you to separate the code that you are testing from it's related dependencies
        - use mocking features to ensure unit testing is stand-alone
    - In Jest you use mocking  
        - by employing Jest mock functions
        - makes it easy to test asynchronous code in Jest

// Jest allows Snapshot testing:
    -  Snapshot testing is used by developers to verify that there are no regressions in the DOM of our apps after some changes to the code base are made
